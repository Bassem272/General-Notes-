To register your custom validation rule in Laravel, you need to add it to the `boot` method of the `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider` class. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Create your custom validation rule class if you haven't already. In your case, it's the `OrderItemsRule` class.

2. Open the `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider.php` file.

3. In the `boot` method of the `AppServiceProvider`, use the `Validator` facade's `extend` method to register your custom validation rule. Here's an example:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Validator;
use App\Rules\OrderItemsRule;

public function boot()
{
    Validator::extend('order_items_rule', function ($attribute, $value, $parameters, $validator) {
        // Here you can call your custom validation logic from the OrderItemsRule class
        $orderItemsRule = new OrderItemsRule();
        return $orderItemsRule->passes($attribute, $value);
    });

    // Other code in the boot method...
}
```

In this example, we've registered a custom validation rule named `'order_items_rule'` using the `Validator::extend` method. Inside the closure, we create an instance of your `OrderItemsRule` class and call its `passes` method to perform the validation.

4. Now you can use your custom validation rule by specifying the custom rule name `'order_items_rule'` in your validation rules array, as shown earlier:

```php
$order_items' => ['required', 'order_items_rule'],
```

With these steps, your custom validation rule should be registered and ready to use throughout your Laravel application.
