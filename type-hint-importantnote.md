Certainly, let's address point 4 and point 8 in your code:

**Point 4: Redundant Query**

In the `show` method of your `ProductController`, you are first retrieving the product using the parameter `$product`, which is a model binding. Then, you are retrieving it again using `Product::find($product->id)`. This is redundant because Laravel's model binding already provides you with the product instance based on the route parameter.

Here's your original code:

```php
public function show(Product $product)
{
    $product = Product::find($product->id); // Redundant query
    return response()->json(['message' => 'Product found', 'product' => $product], 200,
        ['Content-Type' => 'application/json;charset=UTF-8', 'Charset' => 'utf-8'],
        JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
}
```

You can simplify this code by removing the redundant query:

```php
public function show(Product $product)
{
    return response()->json(['message' => 'Product found', 'product' => $product], 200,
        ['Content-Type' => 'application/json;charset=UTF-8', 'Charset' => 'utf-8'],
        JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
}
```

In this modified code, you can directly use the `$product` instance provided by Laravel's model binding.

**Point 8: Model Binding**

Laravel's model binding allows you to automatically resolve Eloquent models from route parameters. In your `ProductController`, you're already using model binding for the `show` method:

```php
public function show(Product $product)
{
    // ...
}
```

In this method, Laravel automatically retrieves the `Product` model instance corresponding to the `product` route parameter. This simplifies your code and eliminates the need to manually fetch the model from the database.

Here's how it works:

1. When a request is made to a URL like `/products/1`, Laravel identifies that `1` is the `product` route parameter.

2. It looks at the type-hint in the method (`Product $product`) and automatically queries the `Product` model with the `id` of `1` from the database.

3. The retrieved `Product` instance is then passed as an argument to your `show` method.

By using model binding, you make your code more concise and avoid the need for repetitive database queries to fetch model instances based on route parameters.
