To send emails from your Laravel application using Gmail, you need to configure your Gmail account to allow third-party applications to access it. Here are the general steps to follow:

1. Log in to your Gmail account and go to the "Security" section of your account settings.
2. Turn on "2-Step Verification" and follow the prompts to set it up.
3. Generate an app password for your Laravel application. This is a unique password that you'll use to authenticate your application with Gmail.
4. In your Laravel application, open the `.env` file and set the `MAIL_MAILER` variable to `smtp`.
5. Set the `MAIL_HOST` variable to `smtp.gmail.com`.
6. Set the `MAIL_PORT` variable to `587`.
7. Set the `MAIL_USERNAME` variable to your Gmail email address.
8. Set the `MAIL_PASSWORD` variable to the app password you generated in step 3.
9. Set the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` variable to `tls`.
10. Save the `.env` file.

After setting up the `.env` file, you can use Laravel's built-in email functionality to send emails using Gmail as your email service. You can find more information about sending emails in Laravel using Gmail in the official documentation: [Laravel Mail Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/mail).
